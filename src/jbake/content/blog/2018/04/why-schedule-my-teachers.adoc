=== To Save Time

Using Schedule My Teachers saves administrators an average of 9 hours! That’s the power of our school schedule maker. You’ve got better things to do than spend a day and a half creating your school’s class schedule, so let us help you get back to the more important things.

=== To Find the Best Schedule Possible

When you make your school schedule by hand, it’s tempting to stop searching for solutions once you’ve found a schedule that works. But by settling for the suboptimal, you could be affecting student learning and teacher satisfaction. Schedule My Teachers helps you find the best schedule possible given your needs and wants.

=== Because it’s Easy to Use

Our school schedule maker is intuitive and designed with the user in mind. The scheduler consists of six easy steps, each with helpful descriptions and hints right on the page. We also put a tutorial tab in the scheduler itself. This means that our step-by-step tutorial videos (hyperlink to YouTube) are just a click away if you need them. Each one clearly demonstrates exactly how to complete each step.

So what are you waiting for? Simultaneously make the best school schedule with ease and save time today!
